# Team6
Team project from CPSC5200

Description:
    The project implements a worldwide Address Search Application using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) stack. Address validation and searching uses country-specific addresses forms with real-time responses to user inputs. This project involves a dynamic web-based UI form along with a RESTful API built on the MERN architecture for handling backend operations. Currently the countries supported consist of Brazil, Canada, Germany, India, Japan, North and South Korea, Mexico, Spain, The United Kingdom, and The United States of America.
    The design of this project aims to be as easily extensible as possible for updating new countries to the system.

    prerequisites: Have node installed

    cd server
